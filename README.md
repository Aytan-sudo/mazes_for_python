# Mazes For Python



Maze For Python allows to generate png mazes, of variable size, coded according to various algorithms.

A 17 square maze :

A 34 square maze :

Available algorithms :
- Binary tree (fast and simple, biaised)
- Aldous broder (perfect maze, slow and high-cost memory)
- Hunt and kill (long rivers, biaiased, low memory)

There is theoretically no limit to the size of the labyrinth. But the algorithms have different performances.

Mazes in python is freely inspired by the book "Mazes for programmers", which offers code in Ruby. It is completely recoded in python.


Future Projects (not yet implemented):
- Add Djkistra algorithm to compute the shortest path between 2 points
- Add the A-star algorithm to calculate the shortest path between 2 points
- Colors to visually estimate the distance
